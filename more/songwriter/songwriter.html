<h1>Taylor, a gifted songwriter</h1>
  
  <p> Taylor Swift is an American artist and performer. But she is also known for her incredible songwriting skills. She indeed won some awards for it. <br>
    Swift participated in the songwriting process of the entirety of her discography. Some songs were co-written and some were solo written. <br>
    Although she is an amazing singer and vocalist, she also wrote some songs for other artists and for movies and series as well. <br>
    Sometimes her songs are used in the audiovisual field even though her songs weren't destined for that specific movie or series <br>
  </p>

  <p><img src="sugarland.jpeg" alt="picture 2" class="img"></p>
  <p> <em>"Babe"</em> is in the same situation as <em>"Better Man"</em>. Taylor also co-wrote it with Sugarland during her Red era and later on rerelased it on <em>"Red (Taylor's Version)</em>. <br>

<h3>THIS IS WHAT YOU CAME FOR FOR CALVIN HARRIS</h3>

<p><img src="calvin.jpeg" alt="picture 3" class="img"></p>
<p> Taylor Swift collaborated with Calvin Harris who was at the time her boyfriend. She wrote that song which was sung by Rihanna. <br>
  Calvin Harris and Taylor Swift both knew the song would be a hit, but Taylor wrote it for Calvin and they both agreed it was a bad idea to let the world know they collaborated as a couple, they thought it would overshadow the song.<br>
  In the songwriting credit was credited someone named Nils Sjoberg. Eventually, a representative for Swift confirmed that Swift wrote the song under that secret name.
