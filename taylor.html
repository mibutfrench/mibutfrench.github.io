<h1>Taylor Swift</h1>
<p>
  Taylor Swift is an American artist, known for her brilliant songwriting skills and her enchanting voice. She started off as a country artist at 16 with her debut album with hit singles <em>“Picture To Burn”</em> or <em>“Our Song”</em>. <br>
  She then became famous with her worldwide country hit <em>"Love Story"</em> in her 2nd album named <em>“Fearless"</em>. <br>
  She gained multiple awards for her work. Her album <em>"Speak Now"</em> won “Album Of The Year” at the 2012 Grammy awards ceremony. She wrote this album entirely by herself without any co-writers at only 19 years old. <br>
  She then released her 4th studio album <em>“Red”</em> which contains more than 3 genres : pop, rock, country, electro-dance, etc… It is indeed her most versatile album. <br>
  In 2015, she became the most popular artist with her first pop album : <em>"1989"</em> (which is also her birth year). With 7 charting songs on the Billboard Hot 100 she broke the record of the most charting album in history. Her song <em>“Shake It Off”</em> shook the world ! <br>
  After being dragged by the medias, pictured as an annoying serial dater girl, and since she received a lot of hate, she retired herself from the social media’s radar and nobody physically saw her for an entire year. She then made an iconic comeback with her 6th album <em>“reputation”</em>. <br>
  Her “reputation stadium tour” was predicted to be the biggest flop. It turned out to be the most selling tour in America.<br>
  2 years later she released her 9th studio album named <em>“Lover”</em> which was supposed to get an international tour called “Loverfest” but Covid-19 changed her plans. The same year she released a documentary on Netflix <em>“Miss Americana”</em> which tackles her hiatus and the political issues she fights for. <br>
  And when we were all quarantined, too busy being bored, she released 2 entire albums. The first one is <em>“folklore”</em> which was her first surprise album. Nobody expected it. She indeed announced her 9th album release date the day it was going to be released. <br>
  It is her first indie album with cohesive sounding songs. Her songwriting stood out the most in that album. Taylor Swift also released a documentary on Disney+ <em>“folklore long pond studio versions”</em> with live recording versions of her new songs. <br>
  Her second surprise album <em>“evermore”</em> was released the same year on her birthday, the 13th of December. It is considered as the sister album of <em>“folklore”</em>. <br>
  In the meantime back in 2019, her manager Scooter Borchetta selled the label to the well known manager Scooter Braun. He now owns all her first six albums and earned money from her past work. He agreed to give her back her albums one by one each time she would release a new album. She refused because it wasn’t fair.<br>
  Therefore Taylor Swift is now in the process of re-recording her first 6 albums. <em>“Fearless (Taylor’s Version)”</em> was released in march 2021. Her rerecordings contain Vault Tracks which are songs that she originally didn’t put out in the album. Those are songs that her audience had never heard. <br>
  And in November 2021, she released <em>“Red (Taylor’s Version)”</em> which is a 30 songs album. The last track of her album is a 10-minute-song and yet it was still charting on the Billboard Hot 100 for nearly 4 weeks. Which is practically impossible for a 30th track that lasts 10 minutes. Fans are speculating that the next rerecording will be whether <em>"1989 (Taylor’s Version)""</em> or <em>"Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)"</em> ! <br>

  <h2 id="red">4) Red (Taylor's Version) </h2>

  <p>Red is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on October 22, 2012<br>
    The album's title refers to the tumultuous, "red" emotions Swift experienced during the album's conception; its songs discuss the complex and conflicting feelings resulting from fading romance.<br />
    Taylor Swift said that she named her album "Red" because to her mind, the emotions pictured in that album are red, they're intense, love, passion, heartbreak, pain, etc...<br>
    Hoping to experiment with new sounds that would expand her music beyond its traditional country pop style, Swift engaged new producers such as Dan Huff, Max Martin, Shellback, and Jeff Bhasker, alongside her long-time collaborator Nathan Chapman. <br>
    The final product was an album coalescing country, pop, and rock with folk and electronic elements, drawing from sub-genres such as arena rock, Britrock, dance-pop, and dubstep. <br>
    The album was supported with seven singles, four of which peaked inside the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100; the lead single <em>"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"</em> topped the chart, while <em>"Begin Again"</em>, the closing track, as well as <em>"I Knew You Were Trouble"</em>, and <em>"Red"</em> reached numbers eight, two, and six, respectively. <br>
    The album spent seven weeks atop the U.S. Billboard 200, making Swift the first female artist and the second act since the famous British band, The Beatles to have three consecutive albums spend at least six weeks at number one.<br>
    It topped the charts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as well. <em>"Red"</em> is certified seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and has received multi-platinum certifications in other countries. <br>

    In November 2021, Swift rereleased her iconic album, propulsing <em>"Red (Taylor's Version)"</em> on top of the debut album charts. She also collaborated with "Starbucks" and proposed a special coffee to her fans all around the world.<br>
    Her album included nine vault tracks that swifties, <em>"Ronan"</em>, was a song she'd written for a little boy who died of cancer. That song being albumless she decided to include it in the rerecording since she wrote it during her Red era. <br>
    <em>"Better Man"</em>, and <em>"Babe"</em> are two songs that Swift wrote for other artists. <em>"I Bet You Think About Me"</em> is a country song that features Chris Stapleton. <br>
    Her famous song <em>"All Too Well"</em>, the 5th track of her 4th studio album was originally 10 min long, but since it's predicted that a 10 min song won't be streamed as much as shorter songs, Swift had to cut it to 5min. <br>
    Rerecording her albums, she had the chance to show her fans the real and entire version of that song, she also released a short film for it starring Dylan O'brien and Sadie Sink as lead actors.

  <h2 id="nine">5) 1989 </h2>

  <p>On October 27th 2014, Taylor Swift released her fifth studio album, 1989 which includes several of her biggest hits<br>
    The album was named after her birth year as a symbolic rebirth of her artistry. Indeed her 4th album <em>"Red"</em> couldn't be defined as a country record nor pop one. After the controversial critics Swift received, she decided it was time for a whole genre shift. Thus she released her first pop album. <br>
    Inspired by 1980s synth-pop to create a record that shifted her sound and image from country to mainstream pop, Swift enlisted Max Martin as co-executive producer <br>
    <em>"1989"</em> describes the exciting life of a young adult. In that album she tackles topics like moving to New York, past failed romance, friends, love, moving on etc... <br>
    After the album's release, Swift embarked on the phenomenal 1989 World Tour, which was the highest-grossing tour of 2015. The album was supported by seven singles, including three US Billboard Hot 100 number ones: <em>"Shake It Off"</em>, <em>"Blank Space"</em>, and <em>"Bad Blood"</em>. Critics praised Swift's songwriting in 1989 for offering emotional engagement that they found uncommon in the mainstream pop scene. <br>
    The album appeared on several publications' lists of the best albums of the 2010s and featured in Rolling Stone's 2020 revision of their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. <br>
    At the 58th Grammy Awards in 2016, 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, making Swift the first female solo artist to win Album of the Year twice. <br>
    Her 1989 era was one of her most properous. But in the meantime she had to deal with an eating disorder caused by public media. She raised awareness about it in her documentary released in 2019 where she revealed that she did exercise a lot but she wasn't always eating. <br>
    The medias portrayed her as a serial dater that jet sets around the world collecting men, but she's so clingy that they leave her and then she would cry in her marble bathtub surrounded by pearls. At first she thought it was really unfair for her to be represented so wrongly by the medias.<br>
    But then she realized it was actually a very interesting character that they are creating. Therefore she used it as a source of inspiration for one of her biggest hit <em>"Blank Space"</em>.
    She also wrote a song for the haters <em>"Shake It Off"</em>, which turned out to be one of the biggest pop song ever. It made her worldwide known, everybody has already heard that song !
  </p>

  <h2 id="rep"> 6) reputation </h2>

  <p><em>"reputation"</em> is the sixth studio album by Taylor Swift. It was released on November 10, 2017 after the artist's hiatus.<br>
    Influenced by the commotion, Swift wrote <em>"reputation"</em> under two major themes; one drawing from the excessive gossips surrounding her, and the other about finding love amidst the tumultuous events. She recruited producers Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, and Shellback in the album's production. <br>
    To coordinate with the album's motifs, Swift did not promote <em>"reputation"</em> through press interviews, unlike her previous efforts. She said in an interview that if she would have promoted it, none of the questions she would get asked would be about the album. <br>
    Various singles supported the album : <em>"Look What You Made Me Do"</em>, <em>"Delicate"</em>, <em>"...Ready For It"</em> etc...
    Critical response to Reputation was generally positive; reviewers were divided on the brash sound and harsh themes that characterized <em>reputation</em>, but praised Swift's resilient songwriting, specifically on the songs about romantic intimacy. Some critics felt the album is a personal record in which Swift becomes vulnerable to a sincere lover and discovers her inner self.<br>
    The album was Swift's fourth consecutive album to debut atop the US Billboard 200. <em>"repuation"</em> became the world's best selling album by a female artist. <br>
    It was supported by the Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), which was speculated to be a flop, became the highest-grossing North American tour of all time.
  </p>

  <h2 id="lover">7) Lover </h2>

  <p>Taylor Swift released her 7th studio album <em>"Lover" on August 23rd 2019 after a change of label.</em><br>
    Swift sought to make an album with bright and lighter tones focusing on the foundational strengths of her songcraft, recalibrating from the dark trope of its predecessor, <em>"repuation"</em>. <br>
    Swift enlisted producers Jack Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little. She also features The Dixie Chicks and Brandon Urie from the band Panic At The Disco. <br>
    Described by her as "a love letter to love itself", the lyrical scope of Lover covers all facets of love, ranging from contentment, infatuation, endearment, lust, and heartache, to political themes such as feminism, equality, and disillusionment. <br>
    Four singles supported the album: "Me!", "You Need to Calm Down", "Lover", and "The Man", the first three of which reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. All of the album's 18 tracks charted on the Hot 100, breaking the all-time female record for the most simultaneous entries.Lover was the best-selling studio album of the year and made Swift the world's best-selling musician of 2019. <br>
    Swift was said to have planned to tour in 2020. Loverfest was cancelled because of covid. Fans think she would've made of her song <em>"Cruel Summer"</em> a hit. It would've indeed break records if she would've chose this song as one of the main singles. <br>
    Critics reviewed Lover positively, mostly praising its emotional evolution and free-spirited style. Lover contains one of her most vulnerable track <em>"Soon You'll Get Better"</em> which tackle her mother's fight agaisnt cancer. <br>
  </p>

  <h2 id="folklore">8) folklore </h2>

  <p><em>"folklore"</em> is the eighth studio album by Taylor Swift. It was a surprise album, released on July 24, 2020.<br>
    After the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, Swift cancelled her planned sixth concert tour, Lover Fest, and quarantined herself, during which she conceived Folklore as "a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness" out of her imagination. <br>
    Swift collaborated with producers Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff virtually; she recorded her vocals at a home studio she built in a bedroom of her Los Angeles residence, while Dessner and Antonoff worked from Hudson Valley and New York City, respectively. <br>
    Influenced by loneliness during the quarantine, Swift explores themes of escapism, empathy, romanticism and nostalgia in the album, through a set of characters, fictional narratives and story arcs, in contrast to the autobiographical tone of her previous projects.<br>
    The title was inspired by her desire for the music to have a lasting legacy akin to folk songs, whereas its artworks and aesthetic reflect cottagecore.<br>
    Upon release, <em>"folklore"</em> broke the Guinness World Record for the biggest opening day on Spotify for an album by a female act.<br>
    Three of its tracks reached the top 10 of the record charts in eight countries, <em>"cardigan"</em>, <em>"the 1"</em> and <em>"exile"</em>. <br>
    <em>"folklore"</em> received widespread critical acclaim, centering on its emotional weight, poetic lyricism and relaxed pace. Critics found its introspective essence timely for the pandemic and regarded its sound a bold reinvention of Swift's artistry. <br>
    The album was featured on numerous 2020 year-end best albums lists, often referred to as the quintessential lockdown record. It won the Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making Swift the first female artist in history to win the honor three times, following the victories for Fearless (2008) and 1989 (2014). <br>
    Swift discussed <em>"folklore"</em> and performed it live in the Disney+ concert documentary "Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions", followed by the release of folklore's sister album, <em>"evermore"</em>, two weeks later. <br>
    A demo version of the deluxe edition bonus track, <em>"the lakes"</em>, commemorated the album's first anniversary. This version was said to be the first version that Jack Anthonoff had come up with for this song.
  </p>

  <h2 id="evermore">9) evermore </h2>

  <p><em>"evermore"</em> is the ninth studio album released by Taylor Swift. It came out on December 11, 2020, less than five months after the singer's eighth studio album, folklore. <em>"evermore"</em> was a spontaneous product of Swift's extended collaboration with her Folklore co-producer Aaron Dessner, with whom she developed a creative chemistry.<br>
    Her 9th album features famous girl band HAIM, Bon Iver which was already featured on her previous record, as well as The National for the song <em>"coney island"</em>.<br>
    Swift launched <em>"evermore"</em> as a surprise album alike Folklore's release, dubbing them as sister records. She described Evermore as an offshoot of "the folklorian woods", which is an escapist, cottagecore-inspired.<br>
    Only one single made it to the radio <em>"willow"</em>, but fans picked a different favorite. Indeed <em>"champagne problems"</em>, a song about a failed proposal became one of the most streamed song off of <em>"evermore"</em>.<br>
    Earning widespread acclaim from music critics, Evermore was praised for its character studies, experimental production, and Swift's nuanced, expressive vocal performances.<br>
    Taylor Swift's songwriting skills were highlighted in the best way in that indie record. <br>
