<h1>Taylor, a gifted songwriter</h1>
  
  <p> Taylor Swift is an American artist and performer. But she is also known for her incredible songwriting skills. She indeed won some awards for it. <br>
    Swift participated in the songwriting process of the entirety of her discography. Some songs were co-written and some were solo written. <br>
    Although she is an amazing singer and vocalist, she also wrote some songs for other artists and for movies as well.<br>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Songs Taylor wrote for other artists or co-wrote with other artists</h2>
  
  <h3> Better Man for Little Big Town </h3>
  
  <p> Taylor Swift wrote <em>"Better Man"</em> in her Red era and sent it to the band Little Big Town. <br>

  <h3> Babe for Sugarland </h3>
  
  <p> <em>"Babe"</em> is in the same situation as <em>"Better Man"</em>. Taylor also co-wrote it with Sugarland during her Red era and later on rerelased it on <em>"Red (Taylor's Version)</em>. <br>
    The only difference is that the song originally features her unlike <em>"Better Man"</em> which only features her in the songwriting credit.

<h3> This Is What You Came For for Calvin Harris</h3>

<p> Taylor Swift collaborated with Calvin Harris who was at the time her boyfriend. She wrote that song which was sung by Rihanna. <br>
  Calvid Harris and Taylor Swift both knew the song would be a hit, but Taylor wrote it for Calvin and they both agreed it was a bad idea to let the world know they collaborated as a couple, they thought it would overshadow the song.<br>
  In the songwriting credit was credited someone named "Nils Sjoberg". Eventually, a representative for Swift confirmed with the magazinge "People" that Swift wrote the song under that secret name.
