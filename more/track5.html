  <h2 id=cold>1) Cold As You </h2>
    
  <p> <em>"Cold as You"</em> is the fifth track of Swift’s debut album and details her experience with an emotionally unavailable guy. Unlike Shakespeare who compares his lover to a summer’s day Swift compares her lover to a cold, rainy day. <br>
     She told Rolling Stone that this is her favorite song on the album. In the interview, she said : <br>
     "The hook is <em>“I’ve never been anywhere cold as you”</em>. I love a line in a song where afterward you’re just like <strong> burn </strong>." <br>
     Swift penned this song with her frequent collaborator Liz Rose. She explained it in publicity materials : <br>
     "I wrote this song with Liz, and I think the lyrics to this song are some of the best we’ve ever written. It’s about that moment where you realize someone isn’t at all who you thought they were, and that you’ve been trying to make excuses for someone who doesn’t deserve them. <br>
     And that some people are just never going to love you. We were halfway through writing this when I started singing ‘And now that I’m sitting here thinking it through, I’ve never been anywhere cold as you’. <br>
     Notably, <em>"Cold As You"</em> is responsible for beginning Taylor’s track record of the 5th song of each of her albums being “emotional vulnerable” ballads.

  <h2 id=white>2) White Horse (Taylor's Version) </h2>
  
  <p> Taylor wrote <em>"White Horse"</em> with Liz Rose. She talked about the song with IHeartRadio :<br>
    "And it was just about comparing the fairytale imagery we are taught as kids, comparing it to what can really happen in young love and young heartbreak, and how you just expect a happily ever after type thing. (…)<br>
    But I’ve always been so proud of this one. And every time I sing it still, I get so emotional, cause it’s really that emotion that’s just on the surface. Every time I hear this song, it’s like, ‘It’s too late for you and your white horse to catch me now.’ <br>
    It’s like that coming of age where you realize you’re stronger than wanting that happily ever after, you want something better for yourself. (…)"<br>
    Funny enough, White Horse could’ve been a “from the vault” song, since it wasn’t going to be in the original album. Taylor said in 2010 :<br>
    I actually wasn’t going to put this song on the album. I was going to wait for the third album because I really felt like we had the “sadness” represented on this record. <br>
    Then my agency out in LA set up a meeting with executive producers Betsy Beers and Shonda Rhimes at Grey’s Anatomy because that’s my favorite show. (…) I played them <em>"White Horse"</em>.<br>
    It was just me and my guitar and they freaked out. They loved it. (…) we didn’t know if we were going to put it on the record because if it wasn’t going to be on the show, then we weren’t going to put it on the album. <br>
    Then they called and said they were very interested in the song. We recorded it right away, sent it off to them, and they put it in !"<br>
  </p>
  
  <h2 id=dear>3) Dear John </h2>
  
  <p><em>"Dear John"</em> is an ode to Taylor’s short-lived relationship with fellow singer-songwriter John Mayer. Taylor conveys her feelings of frustration over the way she was treated by John and how she disregarded the warnings from others. <br>
    Besides the obvious song title, there are multiple references to Mayer directly, including the mention of their over ten-year age gap. Sonically, Taylor purposefully added guitar slurring to the background instrumentals, a guitar playing technique seen all throughout Mayer’s music.<br>
    The two notably collaborated on Mayer’s 2010 song <em>"Half of My Heart"</em> which was released 4 months before <em>"Dear John"</em>.<br>
    Besides John’s public statement to Rolling Stone in 2012, Mayer also replied to Taylor's song three years later, in his 2013 song <em>"Paper Doll"</em>.<br>
    In the song, John directly replies to Taylor’s line, <em>“you paint me a blue sky then go back and turn it to rain”</em> with, <em>“and if those angel wings don’t fly, someone’s going to paint you another sky”.</em> <br>
    Notably, <em>"Dear John"</em> was the third song to contribute to Taylor’s streak of having “emotional vulnerable” ballads as the 5th track of an album.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id=atw>4) All Too Well (Taylor's Version) </h2>
  
  <p> Widely regarded as one of Swift’s best songs, <em>"All Too Well"</em> sees her picking up shards of memories after a gut-wrenching breakup. She jumps through time to reflect on her best and worst memories with her ex, making the listener feel as though they were there with the couple. <br>
    Swift told Pop Dust that she began writing the song in a soundcheck for her 2011 tour in support of her thrid studio album <em>"Speak Now"</em>. Co-writer Liz Rose explained that the song was initially 10-15 minutes long before she helped Swift pare it down. <br>
    Melodically, this version of <em>"All Too Well"</em> is more subdued than the version we hear on the album. This change is evident throughout the song. This version begins with a saccharine melody before building up to a steady drum beat, while the original is heavily backed by guitar. <br>
    Many believe Taylor Swift took inspiration from her relationship with actor Jake Gyllenhaal — the secret message “Maple Lattes” is hidden in the song’s liner notes, and the two shared those coffees in November 2010. <br>
    In a 2015 interview with Howard Stern, Gyllenhaal claimed to not know that Swift wrote a song about him, though she seemingly told Vulture he reached out to her after hearing the album. <br>
    <em>"All Too Well"</em> was the fourth song to contribute to Swift’s “Track Five pattern,” a pattern fans have noted where she puts one of the most emotive songs on an album as the fifth track. <br>
